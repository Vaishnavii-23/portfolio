          <p>
            I'm a computer science engineer passionate about building backend systems that scale and solve real-world problems. My foundation in core CS fundamentals—algorithms, data structures, and system design—drives how I approach every project.
          </p>
          <p>
            I thrive on understanding how things work under the hood, from API architecture to database optimization. Whether it's designing efficient data pipelines or debugging complex system interactions, I focus on writing clean, maintainable code that stands the test of time.
          </p>
          <p>
            My work spans full-stack development with a strong backend orientation and AI/ML, always seeking to bridge the gap between technical excellence and meaningful user impact.
